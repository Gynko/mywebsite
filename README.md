### 4.1. Phase 1: minimum functional website

Goal: Having a skeleton in place, with routing and base elements, which can afterward be cut in pieces that could be worked on independently. As if in a team.

No fancy Css. Purely "functional". Minimum content.

1. Add header mobile and the links. 
2. Add header desktop and the links.
3. Add Home + Extra sections that can be reached by the header links: articles, message me, cheat sheets
4. Create simple media queries that link mobile and desktop versions.
5. Add routing, create theroutes: home + link to extra section.
